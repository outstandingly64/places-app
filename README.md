# places-app

A simple React web application built with MongoDB, Express, and Node.

Add places you wish to or have traveled to after signing into your authenticated account!

React.js frontend is hosted via Firebase: https://conquer-places-app.web.app

The REST API/Backend is hosted separately via Heroku.

Update: currently setting up image uploading to aws s3 -- heroku does not have file persistent storage, which is causing images not to be saved/displayed.
