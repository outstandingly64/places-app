# Conquer Place

A place-sharing web app built with React. Check it out [here](https://conquer-places-app.web.app).

## Description

Add places (and images) you wish to or have traveled to after signing into your authenticated account! Also, checkout other users' places that they've shared.
**Conquer Place** is a simple React client-side web application that communicates with a Mongo database through a Node/Express REST API that I also built [here](https://github.com/outstandingly64/places-backend).

Uses React Router for route configuration, allowing components to be rendered based on the path entered into the browser's search bar. Upon logging in or signing up, additional routes and components are available that all users to have the capabilities of uploading new places, editing places, and deleting places.

The clinet-side of this application is hosted statically via Firebase.

The Node & Express REST API/Backend is hosted separately via Render.
